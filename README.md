## Social Media Analysis

This project includes a set of lightweight algorithms for extracting and analyzing social media content. The pipeline starts by scraping targeted online sources using Python with BeautifulSoup to extract article titles or post metadata. These are collected across multiple pages and stored for further analysis. In parallel, a bash-based keyword matching script searches through pre-processed textual data (e.g., sentence-level outputs) to identify and quantify the presence of key terms, enabling simple frequency-based trend analysis. Together, these tools support automated monitoring of topics, themes, or narratives across large datasets.
